# Contributing

Thank you for you interest in contributing to MAKit! From commenting to 
reviewing and sending MR requests, all contributions are welcome. 

## Developer environment

Install XCode with command line tools.

## Coding style

Go to XCode preferences -> Text editing tab -> Page guide at column: 80

## Testing

### CI 

The unit tests are run after each push on the repository. 

The integration tests are not run systematically, neither are the examples.

Once the MR is "ready to review", please trigger the workflows on GitHub 
to ensure these additional tests have completed. 

### Local 

Testing the unit tests on XCode is straight forward.
Testing the integration tests and the examples require an additional setup. 
More information in the README.
