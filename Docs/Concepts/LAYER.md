# ðŸ“š Layer

The `Layer` is the essential component of `MAKit`. 
A layer has 2 principle characteristics: an operation and a shape. 

In `MAKit` there is a strict correlation between the two. This enforces 
the prominent role of the layer in the framework at the expense of the 
operations as pure mathematical objects. 

Said differently, the layer is the only object that can 
be handled and appended to a model. A layer may be composed of many 
internal operations (for example the batch normalization) but these 
operations can not be mixed into any model without being previously wrapped 
inside a layer.

## Shape

The layer shape is the equivalent of a PyTorch `Tensor`. It 
characterizes the layer internal state, its `neural structure`. 
For now there are only two available shapes: `1D` or `2D`. These suffixes 
appear most of the time in the layer name itself: example `Layer1D`, `Layer2D`.

## API

The layer exposes 3 main APIs: 

- `forward`: the direct propagation of data from the first layer 
  to the last one
- `backward`: the retro propagation of gradients 
  from the last layer to the first one
- `forwardGC`: the direct propagation of data to evaluate the gradients 
  during the gradient checking
  
Each of these API can be run in two execution contexts: CPU or GPU. 

As a low-level component, the layer in fact exposes this execution context 
in the name of the 3 previous APIs: `forwardCPU`, `forwardGPU`, 
`backwardCPU`, `backwardGPU`, forwardGCCPU` and `forwardGCGPU`.

The CPU execution mode should only be run for debug or testing. 
The GPU execution mode is the standard way to go.
