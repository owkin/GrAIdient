/// An object that is passed during the creation of the different layers for them to be added in their
/// `Model` queue.
///
/// The main problem adressed by the model context is to be able to edit the very graph of the
/// deep-learning calls of the model. The basic bricks being the layers, they have to be able to refer to
/// previous ones. Plus, we want these references to be written to the disk in order to load them later.
/// Hence the need of an id for each layer.
/// So now, why not using a global unique id ? This global unique id would be less convenient
/// with multiple mirrored models in the context of federated learning on multiple GPU at once.
/// The current solution allows to consider several "threads" of models.
/// Each thread is composed of models where the id are unique in the given "thread".
/// But looking at another "thread" of mirrored models, we would find the exact same ids.
/// As a conclusion, it appears that the id is not unique, but closely related to the model in which it is used.
